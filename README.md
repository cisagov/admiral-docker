This Docker project serves as the vessel for certificate transparency
scanning performed by the [admiral Python library](https://github.com/cisagov/admiral).

## Running ##

### Running with Docker Compose ###

1. Change the credentials in `secrets`
1. Choose configuration options for `admiral.yml`
1. Start the container and detach:

    ```console
    docker compose up --detach
    ```

## Monitoring ##

The following web services are started for monitoring the underlying components:

- Celery Flower: [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555)
- Mongo Express: [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083)
- Redis Commander: [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)

## Using secrets ##

This composistion passes credentials and configuration options via [Docker
secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/). You need to modify
the files listed in the [secrets](#secrets) section below. To prevent yourself
from inadvertently committing sensitive values to the repository, run
`git update-index --assume-unchanged src/secrets/*`.

## Updating your container ##

### Docker Compose ###

1. Pull the new image from Docker Hub:

    ```console
    docker compose pull
    ```

1. Recreate the running container by following the [previous instructions](#running-with-docker-compose):

    ```console
    docker compose up --detach
    ```

## Image tags ##

The images of this container are tagged with [semantic
versions](https://semver.org) of the [admiral](https://github.com/cisagov/admiral)
Python library that they containerize.  It is recommended that most users
use a version tag (e.g. `:1.4.0`).

| Image:tag | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|`cisagov/admiral:1.4.0`| An exact release version. |
|`cisagov/admiral:1.3`| The most recent release matching the major and minor version numbers. |
|`cisagov/admiral:1`| The most recent release matching the major version number. |
|`cisagov/admiral:edge` | The most recent image built from a merge into the `develop` branch of this repository. |
|`cisagov/admiral:nightly` | A nightly build of the `develop` branch of this repository. |
|`cisagov/admiral:latest`| The most recent release image pushed to a container registry.  Pulling an image using the `:latest` tag [should be avoided.](https://vsupalov.com/docker-latest-tag/) |

See the [tags tab](https://hub.docker.com/r/cisagov/admiral/tags) on Docker
Hub for a list of all the supported tags.

## Building from source ##

Build the image locally using this git repository as the [build context](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#git-repositories):

```console
docker build \
  --build-arg VERSION=0.0.1 \
  --tag cisagov/admiral:1.4.0 \
  https://github.com/cisagov/admiral-docker.git#develop
```

## Cross-platform builds ##

To create images that are compatible with other platforms, you can use the
[`buildx`](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) feature of
Docker:

1. Copy the project to your machine using the `Code` button above
   or the command line:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/cisagov/admiral-docker.git
    cd example
    ```

1. Create the `Dockerfile-x` file with `buildx` platform support:

    ```console
    ./buildx-dockerfile.sh
    ```

1. Build the image using `buildx`:

    ```console
    docker buildx build \
      --file Dockerfile-x \
      --platform linux/amd64 \
      --build-arg VERSION=0.0.1 \
      --output type=docker \
      --tag cisagov/admiral:1.4.0 .
    ```
